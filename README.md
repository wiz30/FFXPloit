  <h2>Features</h2>
</div>

<h3>Auto-response configurable text via FFN tab in settings</h3>

Includes:

* Trigger text
* Response to the triggered text

<ins>How it works:</ins>

Someone sends a message, for example: "oka: hi". And your client responds with "<sender's name>: hi" (<sender's name> can be disabled).

1. Enter text you want your client to respond to in global chat
2. Enter response text that your client will respond with

Example:

<h3>Avoid freezes (may be buggy at specific circumstances)</h3>

Includes:

* Adjustable slider from 0.0 to 5.0 tiles
  
<ins>How it works:</ins>

You get pushed away from a freezing tile, the distance to get pushed from can be set via slider in settings.

1. Check the box saying "Enabled" under "Auto-Move Away from Freeze Tiles:"

Example:

<h3>Auto-shoot laser before entering freezing tile</h3>

Includes:

* Adjustable slider from 0.0 to 5.0 tiles

<ins>How it works:</ins>

You grab laser gun, you ram into the freezing tile, before entering the freezing tile you automatically shoot laser

1. Enable this feature via FFN tab in settings
2. Adjust distance in tiles you want to trigger laser by moving slider (0.0 tiles is totally fine, tested)

> Disable freeze-tiles avoidance, otherwise it will not work

Example:
